## 🎯 Pro Tips

### 1. Keep Server Ready
If you expect client calls, keep the server running:
```bash
npm run web
# Leave it running in background
```

### 2. Have Ngrok Ready
Keep ngrok installed:
```bash
npm install -g ngrok
# Now you can run: ngrok http 3000 anytime
```

### 3. Save Your Message Template
Keep `MESSAGE-TEMPLATE-FOR-CLIENT.txt` open
Copy-paste when client contacts you

### 4. Test Before Client
Before sending, quickly test the URL yourself:
- Open in incognito window
- Try login
- Check main features

### 5. Monitor During Demo
Watch server logs to see what client is doing:
```bash
npm run web
# You'll see client's actions in real-time
```

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Ngrok URL not working"
```bash
# Check if server is running
ps aux | grep node

# Restart if needed
killall node
npm run web
npx ngrok http 3000
```

### "Client can't login"
- Verify credentials: admin / admin123
- Ask client to try incognito mode
- Check if server is still running

### "Ngrok expired"
- Free tier expires after 2 hours
- Just restart: `npx ngrok http 3000`
- Get new URL and send to client

### "Client wants more time"
- Restart ngrok (new 2 hours)
- OR deploy to Railway (permanent)
