# 🎯 How to Let Your Client Try the System

You have **TWO OPTIONS** for letting your client test the application:

---

## Option 1: 🌐 Web Version (Online - Instant Access)

**Client accesses through browser - NO download needed!**

### ⚡ Fastest: Use Ngrok (2 Minutes)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start web server
npm run web

# Terminal 2: Get public URL
npx ngrok http 3000
```

**Send the ngrok URL to your client → They can access immediately!**

### Pros:
- ✅ **Instant** - Client can access in 60 seconds
- ✅ **No download** - Works in any browser
- ✅ **Works on any device** - Desktop, tablet, phone
- ✅ **Easy to update** - Just refresh the page
- ✅ **Try before download** - Client tests before commitment

### Cons:

## Option 2: 💻 Desktop Version (Windows .exe)

**Client downloads and runs .exe file - Full offline app**

### 🔧 How to Create

**Method A: GitHub Actions (No Windows PC needed)**
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push

# GitHub Actions builds Windows .exe automatically
# Download from Actions tab
```

**Method B: On Windows PC**
```bash
npm install
npm run build:win
```

### 📦 Package for Client
```bash
./create-client-package.sh
```

**Send the ZIP file to client → They extract and double-click .exe**

### Pros:
- ✅ **Offline capable** - No internet needed
- ✅ **Full features** - Thermal printer support
- ✅ **Professional** - Standalone application
- ✅ **Your source code protected** - Only compiled app

### Cons:
- ❌ Client must download (~150-200 MB)
