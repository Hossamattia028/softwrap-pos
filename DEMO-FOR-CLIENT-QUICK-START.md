# ðŸš€ Quick Start: Let Your Client Try the System Online

## âš¡ Fastest Methods (Choose One)

---

### Method 1: Ngrok (2 Minutes - Temporary Demo)

**Best for:** Quick demo right now, temporary testing

```bash
# 1. Start your local server
npm run web

# 2. In another terminal, run ngrok
npx ngrok http 3000
```

**Result:** You get a URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

âœ… **Send this URL to your client - they can access it immediately!**

**Note:** Free ngrok links expire after 2 hours

---

### Method 2: Local Demo Script (Instant - Local Network Only)

**Best for:** Client is in the same location/network as you

```bash
./start-local-demo.sh
```

**Result:** Server runs at `http://YOUR-LOCAL-IP:3000`

âœ… **Client can access it if they're on the same WiFi**

Find your local IP:
```bash
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
```

### Method 3: Railway (5 Minutes - Permanent Free Demo)

**Best for:** Permanent demo link, professional hosting

1. **Create account:** https://railway.app (free)
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub"**
4. **Connect your repo**
5. **Railway auto-deploys!**

**Result:** You get: `https://your-app.railway.app`

âœ… **Permanent link that never expires!**

### Method 4: Quick VPS Deployment (30 Minutes - Professional)

**Best for:** Production-ready hosting

**Requirements:** Ubuntu VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)

```bash
# 1. Upload code to server
scp -r . user@your-server:/var/www/softwrap-pos

# 2. SSH into server
ssh user@your-server

# 3. Run deployment script
cd /var/www/softwrap-pos
